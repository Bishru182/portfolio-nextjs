Hello there, stranger! ðŸ‘‹

I'm buzzing with excitement as I write this from the first-ever Hacknest Meetup! Itâ€™s a fantastic gathering of developers, all eager to learn, build, and grow together. This event is organized by the Software Engineering Student Community of SLIIT, and let me tell youâ€”itâ€™s a blast!

Today, weâ€™re diving into the world of portfolios, learning how to craft and deploy our very first portfolio sites. Itâ€™s all about showcasing our skills and projects, and the vibe is electric!
